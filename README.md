The agricultural industry is essential to the world’sfood production, and it is critical to use cutting-edge technolo-gies to increase crop productivity. We provide a revolutionaryCrop Recommendation System (CRS) that utilizes cutting-edgetechnology to maximize crop output in response to the pressingneed for improvement. Our study incorporates real-time moni-toring of soil conditions, made possible by a custom hardwareconﬁguration that includes sensors for temperature, humidity,phosphorus, potassium, nitrogen, and pH measurements. First,we assembled a large dataset with 22 kinds of agriculturalproduction components. Using many machine learning models,such as ensemble methods and baseline classiﬁers, we wereable to classify crops with an astounding 99% accuracy rate.With the application of these insights, the CRS provides cus-tomized recommendations through an easy-to-use user interfacefor appropriate crops under particular climatic conditions. Oursystem’s innovative combination of hardware sensing capabilitiesand AI-driven decision-making promises to revolutionize cropmanagement practices, offering actionable insights for agricul-tural stakeholders. Our system’s novel integration of AI-drivendecision-making and hardware sensing capabilities promises totransform crop management techniques and provide agriculturalstakeholders with useful insights.
•To integrate real-time prediction model integration withIoT devices improves usability and gives farmers valuableinsights.
•To focus on reducing over-ﬁtting and assuring robust per-formance across varied agricultural contexts, we employa machine learning ensemble model.
